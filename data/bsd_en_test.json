"How is it going
 Wayne?","I'm not too bad.","Thank you very much for coming out today.","How's business lately?","It's been good.","We recently commissioned a new facility so I've been busy managing that.","I read about that on your company website.","Congratulations.","Thank you.","The Japanese market has been very interested in our product.","So having this new facility should satisfy their demand for the next couple of years.","The Japanese market is trending upwards lately.","I was in Japan last month and talked to a couple of potential customers.","They all told me that they are looking for a reliable and consistent supply.","Well
 we are well positioned then.","We have 6 facilities with over 1 million ton capacity.","You also operate your own terminal.","Yes
 so we can control the ship loading and schedule.","Having control over the supply chain is definitely helpful.","Being flexible is really important.","How has the Korean market been lately?","I hear that they aren't looking for long term contracts.","Is that true?","Yes it is.","They are mainly looking for spot contract.","Why is that?","Well they don't want to overcommit to one supplier.","So they prefer to source from various suppliers.","Is that to also keep the price down?","They can compare prices and shop around for the cheapest price.","Sounds like a lot of work.","We could offer them a 10-year contract and they can sit back and relax.","Yeah
 that would make life easier.","We should keep an eye on that market.","Yeah
 there is a lot of changes happening lately.","We should catch up again in a couple months?","That would be good.","Great.","Thank you for your time today.","Thank you as well.","Hi there.","I'm Ryan from Company A.","Hi I'm John from Company B.","How did you like the seminar just now?","It was okay.","They weren't talking about anything new.","Is this your first time at this expo?","Yes it is.","That figures.","What do you mean?","They recycle their presentation so the content is basically the same every year.","Is that allowed?","Well people here don't come for the seminar.","They come to network with people.","And enjoy time out of the office.","I see.","I will keep that in mind for next time then.","So tell me a bit about what you do.","Well we are a trading company and mainly do exports.","Oh we do exports as well.","We are in a sense competitors then.","I guess so.","But depending on the situation
 we could cooperate to share the risk.","Good point.","Here's my card.","Let me know if you ever want to discuss any potential partnerships.","Thank you.","Ben
 did you hear about Company A's facility?","What happened?","There was a fire and they had to evacuate everyone there.","Did the building burn down?","I think so.","Do you think this will affect the market?","Well Company A had recently cut back on their production.","They say it was due to the lack of raw material.","So my answer is no
 it won't affect the market.","Do you think they will go bankrupt?","Maybe.","But this isn't the first time their facility burned down.","What do you mean?","Well
 they have a facility elsewhere before
 and that burned down.","Then a couple years later
 a new facility elsewhere magically burned down as well.","Some say that it was intentional.","So they can claim insurance?","Who knows.","But their reputation isn't that good in the industry.","So you can't help but think maybe it was intentional.","Wow.","If it was intentional
 I hope they don't get away with it.","Well
 that's not up to us to decide.","Time to get back to work now.","Hi this is Sam from the Seattle office.","Oh
 hi Sam.","I haven't heard from you in a while.","Yeah
 there hasn't been much projects going on.","Well
 I assume you're starting to get busy since you're calling me.","That's right.","I wanted to ask you to draft a sales contract today.","It's a short-term sales contract with Company A.","Can you tell me a bit more about the contract?","We're looking to have the contract for a term of two years.","We will be selling automotive parts to them.","What's the volume like?","It will be twelve thousand tons per year.","So one thousand tons per month?","Yes
 it will be shipped monthly.","Okay
 I'll make a standard sales contract based on what I know now.","Yes that would be great.","I can also send you a summary of our business relations and other details.","That would be very helpful.","Once I get your draft
 I'll send it to Company A and get their feedback.","Yes
 let me know what they say and I'll see if their changes are acceptable or not.","Thank you very much.","Anything else you need?","No I think I'm good.","Alright
 have a good one then.","Bye now.","Alright
 here is some company orientation materials.","Thank you.","You can read those later.","I'd like to first explain what our department does.","As you know
 we are a Japanese trading company.","So we do a lot of commodity trading in various industries.","But regardless of the product traded
 the procedures for exporting or importing are generally the same.","Some products have specific requirements like permits or certificates right?","That's right.","Your task will mainly be preparing export documents for products from North America going to Asia.","Elaine in our department will teach you how it's done later.","Do you have any questions so far?","I am okay for now.","Feel free to ask questions.","You might not now what questions to ask now but that's completely normal.","Thank you!","So we have fourteen people in our office including you.","We currently have 4 staff in our department.","Five including you.","I'll show you to your desk in a bit.","You can let me know if you need anything for your table.","Anything?","Like an additional monitor
 desk trays
 things like that.","Oh
 okay.","I'll explain a bit about our other departments now.","We also have a mining department and they have four staff there.","Their main operation is managing mine assets in North America.","Our admin department has five staff and they handle everything from HR
 accounting
 and any office administration.","How about we show you your desk now?","That sounds good!","Come in.","You wanted to talk with me Mr. Ko?","Yes
 so here
 take this business card.","I know you are still new but since you don't have many leads
 you should contact him.","Um
 thank you Mr. Ko.","May I ask who he is and what his relationship is with this company?","I never met him.","Just call him and see what you can do.","Excuse me?","But how am I even going to proceed?","I need to know what type of product he is interested in or what brought his business card to our company in order to make the contact more relatable.","I think you should be more open minded and take whatever work you can.","You shouldn't be looking to pick things you want to do.","Excuse me
 I think you misunderstood me.","I just don't want to be inefficient here.","I also don't want him to feel like this is a cold call.","Just tell him you got the card from me.","But you just said you never met him!","Yumi
 I think you should be focusing on working harder and not complaining about what information you do or do not have.","But Mr. Ko!","Dismissed!","Is this how I am suppose to work?","I mean
 if I just made a silly cold call
 and babbled about Mr. Ko having his business card wondering how it got there
 doesn't that reflect badly on this company?","So
 you need to understand that Mr. Ko has zero sales experience.","That is not what he said.","Trust me
 if he ever had any meaningful experience
 he would not just throw a business card at you.","He has no clue how information regarding leads should be relayed.","Can you show me the business card?","Okay
 so this company is relatively big
 so John should know about it.","I do small cap
 he does large multinationals.","All right
 so I get some background info from John
 and?","Just talk to him
 he will walk you through the process.","Just make sure you never go to Mr. Ko again!","Oh please
 it's not even funny.","He was so condescending
 like we are in school and he is the headmaster or something.","Sorry I laughed
 but he doesn't really do anything to contribute other than make PL sheets
 rearrange where everyone is sitting and control the thermostat.","I think I figured it out.","Oh
 so what was it?","So China has a value added tax applied to all exports.","However
 some products are eligible for a tax redemption.","What's the rate for the value added tax?","It's seventeen percent.","What's the story with wood products then?","Apparently back in 2003
 wood products were eligible for a tax redemption.","But the Chinese government abolished that so the value added tax applies to all primary wood products.","What's the definition of primary wood products?","Things like lumber and logs.","But products that are further processed like plywood or wooden furniture would be eligible for the tax redemption.","Okay
 that makes sense.","Thank you for looking this up.","Yeah
 I just happened to find it on a report issued by Company A.","I also sent an email to our trade compliance department but I think they will get back to us with the same answer.","I'll wait for their confirmation before sending this report to the Tokyo office.","Did they say when they will get back to you?","They said early next week.","They will actually be getting in touch with our Shanghai office to review this.","Oh
 okay.","Let me know when they get back to you then.","Will do.","Ms. Pace
 can I talk to you for a second?","Sure
 what's going on?","Do you remember product E has been on backorder?","Yes
 I remember that.","I was just informed it is discontinued.","I thought we are getting it restocked by the end of next month.","How did you find out about it?","We have 28 backorders for this product.","I have been receiving many inquiries from the customers lately.","They all want to know when it will be restocked
 don't they?","Yes
 those customers are getting impatient.","So I called the manufacturer to see what was going on.","That's when I found out about the discontinuation of the product.","Oh no
 we are going to have some angry customers.","Have you already contacted any of them regarding this issue?","Not yet
 I wanted to let you know first.","You will have to issue a full refund to every single one of them immediately.","Make sure to explain about the situation.","Do you think that is going to satisfy the customers?","Those people have been patiently waiting for months.","They have been looking forward to receiving this products.","This could lead to a bunch of negative reviews on us.","I am aware that online reviews are a vital part of a successful business nowadays.","If customers give us bad reviews
 our business will be badly affected...","Can we offer a discount code or something like that?","To show them how sorry we are for not being able to fulfill their orders this time.","We can certainly do that.","How about issuing a 5 dollar discount coupon per customer?","Honestly I don't think 5 dollars is enough to make those customers happy.","How about 15 dollars?","That's the max I am willing to give.","Sounds fair.","Do you know how to issue an online discount code?","Yes
 I am familiar with it.","Then go ahead and get those backorders taken care of.","Yes
 ma'am!","Hello
 this is Public Relations
 Company B.","Hello
 it's James...","Oh
 m-m-moment
 please.","Um
 anyone
 help!","Oh
 m-Mori-san
 an English-speaking person is on the phone
 can you get it?","What
 me?","I have nobody around who can speak English at the moment.","But I’ve been told I don’t need to get phone calls.","I know
 but it’s an emergency.","Okay
 I’ll do it.","Hello
 this is Mori speaking
 how can I help?","Yes
 it’s James Bond from London office
 and may I speak to Mr. Miyagi
 Advertisement Section?","Well
 sorry
 would you hold on
 please?","Okay.","He wants Mr. Miyagi
 Advertisement.","Um
 we don’t have any Mr. Miyagi in the Advertisement Section.","Ah
 okay.","Hello again
 sorry to have kept you so long.","Hello?","Are you still there?","Oh
 yes
 I can hear you.","Well
 we’re sorry but we don’t have any Mr. Miyagi
 Advertisement Section.","Oh
 really
 then
 is he in another section?","I’m sorry but I’m only a translator
 so I’m not sure
 may I put you through the personnel section?","You could ask them about Mr. Miyagi.","Okay.","Can you hold on then
 I’ll connect the line for you.","Right
 thanks.","Excuse me
 Kosugi-san
 how can I transfer this line to personnel?","Oh
 I’ll do it.","Thank you
 Mori-san
 you saved my life.","I went blank when I heard English.","It’s okay.","Hey
 Misato
 did you hear about that?","What?","The name of our group will be changed again next year.","What
 it was changed only two years ago.","I know
 it will be the 'New Product Development Group'.","So
 they will just add 'New' to the 'Product Development Group' that we have now?","Looks like it.","Before that
 they just switched 'team' in the 'product development team' to 'group'.","RIght.","Then
 before that
 they just took 'design' from the 'product development and design team'.","The work we do is the same
 right?","Yup
 just the name change as usual.","No changes in our members either.","Exactly.","But we still need to reprint our business cards.","And change our group name in the employee database and stuff like that.","We need to email our clients about changes again
 don't we?","You're right.","I'm sure everyone thinks 'again? what changes now?'","It is because of the 'corporate brand image strategies' or something.","Those things are pretty annoying to people who actually do the work.","Seriously.","And developing new products is not our only job.","We do lots of work to improve our current products.","I think the name will change again in a couple of years anyway.","Possible.","But I don't need any more business cards that I can't use!","I just can't get rid of them.","Look inside of my drawer.","Wow.","Why don't you give them to the shredding service next time?","Good idea
 I'll do that when we have the new business cards.","Such a waste of money for printing and paper.","I know
 cost reduction can start here!","As I always feel
 what the management think is good for the company is a bit different from what we think is good.","I know you can't help it with a large company
 but I just don't want them to change the group names this often.","Again
 thank you
 everyone
 for joining this press conference for our new product.","Now
 I'd like to invite our CEO
 Jafali Mensah to join me at the podium and open it up for questions and answers.","Thank you
 Sanjay.","Hello
 everyone.","My name is Jafali Mensah
 and I am the CEO of company A.","I'm pleased to be able to welcome all of you today.","I'm very proud of our new
 next generation security system.","Please feel free to ask any questions.","You
 on the front row.","Please talk into the microphone so everyone can hear you.","Good morning.","My name is Curtis Tucker
 and I'm a reporter from F magazine.","In the presentation
 you mentioned spending seven years developing this product.","In your opinion
 what was the main challenge?","One of our main goals from the beginning was to make it portable
 so the deployment process would be easy.","It was hard to make it small enough while carrying all of the features.","Since this product carries multiple sensors besides a camera
 we had to test many different configurations.","We also had to make sure the surface was fit for a solar panel.","That added another factor
 but we eventually were able to reach the perfect size we were hoping for.","Thank you.","Next question?","You
 on the left.","Thank you.","I'm Johanna Bryant from S times.","In your presentation
 you said this is suitable for schools
 government offices
 and shopping malls.","Do you have plans to make it available for the general public too?","We are trying to make a version for household and small businesses.","It will be a more affordable model.","We are also in the process of testing it to make sure the deployment process is easier for home installment.","We are planning on officially releasing it at the end of this year.","Thank you
 next?","We will start the first period of the safety course \"How to handle laser products\".","I am your instructor
 Tanaka.","I know you all handle lasers in your daily work and are used to handling lasers.","However
 it is possible you ignore the very basic safety measures when you think you know everything.","This class is a refresher course to remind you how careful you were dealing with lasers for the first time.","First
 can you talk about yourself?","I have been working for laser development for 6 years
 and I took a safety class as a new employee.","I am curious if the safety standards have changed since then.","Well
 there have been more accidents in laser experiments
 so inspections for laser companies have been stricter those days.","That's what I thought.","I have been with the laser component group for 4 years.","We deal with components and do not handle lasers themselves much
 so I am wondering if I would learn anything that would be useful for my work in this class.","Your company owns lots of lasers whether your group directly handles lasers or not
 so I think it is a good idea for you to know the basic safety measures no matter what your job might be.","Right
 you never know when you might go to another group in the company.","I don't think you will find this class useless at all.","I am here from the personnel department today.","I rarely interact with lasers
 but I would like to learn something that I can use to protect our employees.","Of course
 I will talk about the eye exams that is important for laser companies
 so please pay attention to those topics.","Okay.","Everyone is in different areas and is interested in different things.","It looks like this class will be fun.","For example
 a class for engineers only would have students with the same interests.","Then
 what I do in my class tends to be narrowly focused.","That's true
 what I want to learn and what Mr. Yamamura wants to learn can be very different.","So
 instead of focusing on fewer topics
 we would be exploring a wider range of topics in this class.","I already have the basic knowledge
 so this will be a good opportunity for me to learn something that I had not even noticed.","I might be able to contribute to this class from the position of a component person.","Let's start then.","Can you look at the first page of the document I handed out earlier?","Oh
 this looks interesting.","The content looks a bit different from when I took a class as a new employee.","When Ms. Matsumoto was new here
 we used to have instructors from a different training center.","We have been working with your company since last year.","Different from when I did it.","That makes me more excited.","He is a popular instructor.","Thank you.","Well
 let's get to the point now.","Stacey
 look at this!","What?","Inside this microwave!","Yikes
 what is this?","It is so dirty.","I think someone warmed up meat sauce pasta or tomato soup and had it exploded.","It looks like that
 but why don't they wipe it off?","Right?","There is always someone who leaves it dirty like this.","Who would that be?","We have lots of people here who bring lunches and warm up
 so we don't know who that is.","How about talking to Jaime at the facility management and ask him to put a note?","Yeah
 like \"Please clean after you make a mess.\"","I thought something like this would be just a common sense.","It doesn't look like it.","This gets dirty like this once every two weeks.","Some people leave their old food for a long time in the fridge at the lunch room
 too.","So true.","You get surprised once in a while when you open it.","What if I ask Jaime to hold a meeting on how to use the lunch room?","Umm
 I wonder if anyone comes.","For now
 a note will do?","Then let's see how it goes.","Well
 I'll go tell Jaime now.","Okay.","But who would clean this now?","Ah
 I don't want to
 but I need to warm up something
 so I'll wipe it off.","Oh
 you're good.","No
 it's not like that
 I just can't stand the mess.","Oh
 some people would use it as it is.","I can never do that.","Me
 neither.","Uchiyama-san.","Yes?","How many registrations do we have from customers attending the ceremony this time so far today?","I've only just sent the notice but we already have replies from 3 companies saying that they will attend.","Are there people bringing their wife or husband?","Umm
 there is 1 couple.","It seems Mr. Sugimoto will be bringing his son this year.","Oh
 he must be the successor to the store.","That's nice.","I'm thinking of talking to Mr. Sato from Travel Agency C in regards to making the bookings soon as flights and also hotels will get full.","Will it be Mr. Yamada who is coming with his wife?","Yes.","Then they will just need one room.","Right
 that was the case last year as well.","I wonder if Mr. Sugimoto will be staying together with his son.","Maybe.","I'll check with both just in case.","Yes
 thank you.","It might be a bit early to discuss this with Mr. Sato.","Yeah.","We've only talked to the customers attending over the phone and haven't gotten the replies on the invitation yet.","It might be better if we wait for a couple more replies from companies first.","Yeah
 let's at least wait until the weekend then do an initial count.","I'm back.","Welcome back.","There was a phone call from Director Sato of A Corporation.","Thank you.","Did you ask what he was calling about?","It seems he would like an invoice for the goods he received the other day.","I hastily prepared one
 but could you check it?","That's a big help.","I'll check it right away
 could you send me the data?","Alright
 I'll send it now.","Suzuki-san
 has the shipping cost been calculated incorrectly?","Perhaps you calculated it with the figures from the first estimate?","Oh
 I'm sorry.","I'll fix that right away.","Thank you.","It doesn't seem like there are any other issues
 so I'll get this sent off to Director Sato.","Thank you
 I'd appreciate it if you could do that.","It's nothing
 it was really helpful that you dealt with it.","Hello
 thank you for calling C Corporation.","Hi
 it's Tanaka.","Hi Tanaka-san
 it's Suzuki.","Ah
 perfect.","I've just come from a visit to Company A
 but I now have to go to the factory on urgent business so it seems like I will be late back to the office.","Okay.","Was there some kind of problem?","I've had a request to increase the number of orders from Company C
 so I'm going to speak directly to the factory manager about this matter.","Oh wow
 congratulations!","Thank you.","It's all thanks to your cooperation in creating the quotes and documents.","What? I didn't do anything.","If you're heading to the factory now
 what time are you likely to return?","Hmm
 well
 it will be after seven at the earliest.","Can I ask you to rewrite my return time on the board?","Alright.","Take care on your way over there.","Thank you.","Our customers have told us that they think our fridge freezer is now a bit bland and old- fashioned looking.","So we are looking to update it and make it more stylish.","Do you have any ideas?","Well
 I think we could make the edges and corners more curved to give it a modern look?","Yes
 that seems to be the trend nowadays.","I think we should add more color options in addition the to the standard white or silver.","I agree.","And it would be good to add some sort of contrasting color somewhere
 like a stripe.","Yes
 maybe one flowing stripe across the entire fridge or one on each compartment.","Ok
 so make it more curvy
 add more color options and add some contrasting color pattern somewhere.","I was also thinking to make the digital display much larger and capable of showing more information.","What kind of information?","Well
 the date and time and I had the idea that customers could set a reminder for when a particular food item will expire.","That's a great idea.","It may help to cut down on food wastage.","Any more ideas anyone?","That's it from me for now.","Nothing else for now.","Well
 if we could all give this some more thought over the next couple of days and get back to me by the end of the week if you have any more ideas.","Thank you Ms. Tsuchiya
 thank you Mr. Uchida.","Thank you very much for your interest in our services.","Thank you for coming to our office today.","Not at all.","We're just a couple blocks down the street so it was close.","So as you may know
 we specialize in creating custom reports.","Right.","You guys are able to make market reports for various industries
 right?","Not all industries.","Our focus is on the automotive and chemical industry.","In some cases
 we may collaborate with another company that has the specialization.","I see.","So just to confirm
 what industry are you interested in?","We're interested in the heavy machinery industry.","We are looking for a report that can show the market forecast along with the supply and demand.","I'm assuming this wouldn't be your company's specialty?","Unfortunately not.","Actually
 we have a sister company that may be able to handle your request.","Is that right?","Yes
 they're called Company A.","Unlike us
 they specialize in industrial facilities and equipments.","So they should be able to have the market intelligence you're looking for.","Can you introduce me to them?","Of course.","I can send you their contact information later.","That would be great.","Thank you very much.","Not at all.","Hi
 this is Colin Jones from Company A.","Hi Colin.","This is Sam Lee from Company B.","And with me is Ben Sherman as well.","Hello there.","Thank you for attending the phone conference today.","So Colin
 as I mentioned in my email
 we are currently looking at acquisition opportunities in the automotive parts industry.","And I happened to stumble upon your company while I was searching around on the web.","I noticed that you guys specialize in M&A support in this industry so I thought it would be a good idea to get in touch with you.","Well
 thank you very much for finding our company.","As you may already know
 our company specializes in M&A support for the automotive parts industry.","I personally have over twenty years of experience working for a major automotive parts company and ten years in the investment banking industry.","So please tell us about your services.","So we offer full support which means identifying potential acquisition targets
 shortlisting
 negotiation
 and closing.","The fee structure will consist of a monthly retainer charge and a two percent fee upon the completion of the acquisition.","Does the two percent apply to the acquisition amount?","That's correct.","So identifying potential targets would fall within the retainer fee?","Exactly.","How much is the monthly retainer fee?","I can put together a proposal in regards to the price and services if you'd like.","That would be good.","What's the approximate retainer fee though?","It is generally around ten thousand dollars a month.","Is that in US dollars?","Yes
 it will be in US dollars.","Got it.","Is there an estimated acquisition amount in mind?","We would be looking to acquire a company for around ten million US dollars.","Okay
 so a small sized company.","That's right.","Acquiring a large company would cost too much.","That's understandable.","You'd want to buy at a lower price
 then grow the company.","Anyways
 I will send you a proposal within this week.","Sounds good.","Thank you very much for your time Colin.","Not at all.","Thank you for arranging the call Sam.","We will look forward to hearing from you.","I can not believe you are leaving us in 3 days.","I am going to miss this place.","I have been working in this office for the last 8 years.","You must have lots of memories here.","Yes
 mostly fond memories.","But this is the best place I have ever worked at so far.","We do have pretty cool bosses and colleagues here.","This place will not be the same without you.","I am pretty sure my successor will do her job just fine.","I heard she has a very impressive resume.","I hope you will enjoy your new office just as much as you did here.","To be honest with you
 I am a little bit nervous.","It's understandable.","It is going to be a big adjustment.","The new office has twice as many employees as this one.","It seems like a competitive environment.","Don't feel discouraged.","With your expertise and experience
 you will be valued.","Thank you for the encouraging words.","I truly enjoyed every minute of working with you.","Please keep in touch.","Absolutely!","I know my new office is two hours away
 but feel free to drop by anytime you are in the area.","I look forward to visiting you.","I wish you the best of luck.","Is this your first day too?","Yes
 I am excited but nervous too.","I am not sure if I am dressed appropriately.","We had uniforms at my last job.","Well
 you sure look professional.","You will be fine as long as your outfit isn't too revealing or has offensive language.","Now I feel a little bit better.","You know
 the first day is always nerve-wracking.","Ms. Kristy Smith is assigned as my mentor.","I am so anxious to have her train me.","She seems a little uptight.","Are you talking about Kristy from Human Resources department?","Yes
 she might not be fond of me.","I actually know her from my college days.","I know she comes off as standoffish sometimes.","But she is a very sweet person once you get to know her.","She just happens to be a person of few words.","That's a relief to know.","I just assumed she disliked me.","Let me tell you about how to let her open up to you.","She is a foodie and loves eating out.","If you get her to talk about the food she loves
 she will keep talking for hours.","Ok
 I am making a mental note of that.","I know many places that offer exquisite cuisines in town.","She would absolutely love to hear all about them.","I really appreciate your advice.","No problem.","We will be working together
 so we need to help each other out.","Good Morning
 thank you for calling Company A Tech support.","This is Jennifer
 how may I help you?","Hello
 I'm having trouble with my laptop.","I was hoping you could help me.","Sure thing ma'am.","Let me get some information from you really quick.","What's your name?","It's Yvonne Smith.","What model of laptop do you have?","I'm not sure.","How can I find out?","If you look at the upper right corner of the keyboard
 it should say.","Ok
 now I see it.","It's says Model A.","Now what seems to be the problem with you computer?","It's frozen.","I try to click the icons on the desktop
 but nothing happens.","When I move the mouse
 the cursor on the screen doesn’t move.","Have you tried restarting it?","Oh no
 I never do that.","I heard that you need to leave your computer on all the time or it might break.","Wait
 what?","No
 it is completely incorrect.","Your computer needs to sleep just like we do.","OK
 but since the mouse doesn't move
 how am I supposed to restart it?","Hold the power button until it shuts down.","OK
 let me try that.","Alright
 it shut down.","Now wait for about a minute.","Ok
 it's been about a minute now.","I want you to push the power button again
 but this time don't hold it down.","Just one soft click.","Wow
 it came right back on.","Let me see if it responds when I move the mouse.","Yes
 it's working.","Great.","Now try opening a program to see if it's working properly.","Yes
 I just opened my internet browser and it seems to be working fine.","Well
 is there anything else I can help you with today Yvonne?","That's it
 thanks for your help!","Hey Ricky
 you asked me about Company A before right?","Yeah
 that's right.","They are the new coal mining company
 right?","Yeah
 I actually received an email from someone I know who worked at the terminal.","And he said he recently changed jobs and will be starting a new position at Company A.","Oh
 really.","Do you think you can set up a meeting with him?","My department has been looking for a new supply of coal for a while so we would be interested in talking.","Okay
 I will ask him if he's available for a meeting.","I think he will be a bit busy since he just changed jobs.","Would next month be okay?","I think so.","Alright
 I'll ask him for his availability next month.","Thank you!","Before I order lunch today
 I wanted to see if you had any dietary restrictions?","No
 I can eat anything.","Oh really?","Even spicy food?","Yeah I actually really like spicy food.","Cool
 well we were thinking of getting biriyani.","Biriyani
 what's that?","It's an Indian mixed rice dish.","It is made with Indian spices
 rice
 meat
 vegetables and eggs.","I always get the chicken.","How about you Bob?","I usually get the goat
 but sometimes do shrimp.","I would really like to try goat.","I've never eaten goat meat before.","I don't like it.","Do you eat spicy food in Japan?","Oh yes
 but it's mostly foreign food like Indian
 or Korean.","Our traditional food isn't spicy.","What about those spicy tuna sushi rolls?","Aren't those Japanese?","Are you talking about wasabi?","No
 the spicy red sauce that they put on the tuna.","I have never heard of that.","Huh
 it must be an American thing.","They're good.","But anyways
 I am going to call Indian Restaurant A.","Please tell me which one each of you want.","Kanako and I are going to order goat
 how about Cindy and Mark?","Welcome everyone
 please be seated.","I'm Tracy with Company A.","This is my colleagues Jim.","Today we're going to show you how your team can use product A to engage with prospective clients as well as your current customers.","Thanks Tracy.","If you're like most businesses
 you track your information using a lot of different tools.","Finding your way through email
 spreadsheets and presentations
 can take up a lot of valuable time.","Product A is a centralized tool where you can track everything you need in one place to run your business.","How much does it cost?","Product A is fully customizable
 so it depends on which setup you choose.","Ben
 please let them get through their presentation.","Tracy
 Jim
 I apologize
 please continue.","Not at all Jerry.","We encourage questions through the entire presentation.","We certainly understand that price is a very important question.","I don't want to give you the wrong price
 so we'll look at a few options later in the meeting.","Jim
 can you tell them about organizing accounts?","Absolutely Tracy.","Product A can organize your contacts
 accounts
 sales deals and documents.","Where does it keep everything?","It runs in the cloud.","So
 all you need is a web browser or a mobile device to access everything.","Wow
 that's really convenient.","I can see how a sales team and management could make use of that.","Yes
 it's great for field reps.","That way when they're travelling
 they can still have access to all of the information back at the office.","Tracy
 tell them how you start a typical day.","The first thing I do is login to Product A and check my home page.","At the top of the page are my tabs which quickly help me find all of the information I need.","Then I write my status update.","What's that used for?","To let my colleagues know what I'm working on now
 and collaborate with them.","“My dashboard” is where I track the business data that is most important to me.","You can follow the business information that matters the most to you.","What sort of business data do you use the most often?","As a business manager
 I need to track my team's deals to see what stage they're in.","Can product A do that?","Absolutely
 you can see all of your team's deals.","You can even set permissions to let them see each others deals.","Wow
 this is really useful!","How are the office rent negotiations going?","The owner is demanding a 20 percent increase.","If he doesn't change his mind
 we should probably look for a new office.","That's not a bad idea.","If we were to find a new place
 we need to consider what is most important.","Yes
 if we found a location further away from downtown
 we could probably get a bigger office for less money.","Since our company is growing
 we could use the extra space.","That sounds good
 but we can't be too far out.","Employees won't want to drive that far each day to come to work.","Also
 some of them use public transportation
 so we shouldn't be too far away from a bus stop.","Will we need to pay any penalty for breaking the current lease?","Yes
 we will need to pay one month's rent.","However
 that is much less than paying an extra 20 percent every month for the rest of the year.","We need to consider security as well.","What is the safest part of town?","The westside and eastside are both safe.","What are the benefits of living on the westside?","The real estate prices are lower than the eastside.","Conversely
 what are the benefits of living on the eastside?","It is more convenient
 and closer to downtown.","What side of town do you live on?","I live on the westside.","How about you?","Yeah
 me too.","I wonder what part of town most of our employees live in.","We should take a poll.","Can you blast an email containing a poll asking what part of town everyone lives in?","Yeah sure.","What do you want the choices to be?","Let's make them north
 south
 east
 and west.","Then
 let's start looking at real estate in the area that gets the most votes.","Although I know it will be less expensive
 I'm going to miss working downtown.","Not only is it convenient
 it's so much fun!","If we move out to the eastside or westside
 we can't do as many team lunches or happy hours.","I hope that doesn't bring down morale.","Well
 we can certainly look at other properties downtown
 and see if there is one for less than what we are paying now.","Besides
 we're just going to collect some data.","It never hurts to look.","You're absolutely right.","If we find some places we like
 we will have to have a big discussion with all of the managers.","Hello Mr. Kato.","Hi Mr. Toyama.","I hope I'm not bothering you by coming to your office without emailing you first.","It's not a problem at all.","Did you want to ask me something?","Yes
 I haven't been feeling well this morning.","I think I may be coming down with a cold.","Oh no that's terrible.","Did you start feeling ill this morning?","Well
 I woke up late last night and was coughing.","I thought I could still come into work
 but I started feeling much worse after arriving.","Would it be ok if I left work early?","I understand it isn't easy to work while you are feeling ill.","Also
 it would not be good if others in the office got sick.","Right
 I really don't want to get everyone sick.","So it's ok to go home early today.","Please get some rest and email me tomorrow to let me know how you are feeling.","Thank you
 I'll email you tomorrow.","That sounds good.","Just take care of yourself for now.","Thank you
 I hope I can get over this soon.","Definitely
 go take a rest.","Hi Mr. Williams.","Hello Mr. Taylor.","I brought you in to talk about your performance over the past two months.","Unfortunately
 it seems like you've been underperforming compared to your coworkers.","Is everything OK with you?","Yes
 everything is fine.","However
 I have been distracted by some personal issues in my life.","Actually
 my father is in the hospital with heart issues.","This has made it difficult to focus on work lately.","I'm sorry to hear that.","I hope your father is recovering.","Thank you.","It would be OK if you need to take some time off to be with your family.","I'm sympathetic to family concerns.","However
 I need you to come back ready to work.","We have have many important deadlines next month
 and I will need you to be focused on work.","Thank you for your understanding.","I think a week off from work would be helpful to clear my mind.","No problem.","I was going to suggest you to take one week off.","I understand.","Please spend the time with your family and don’t think about work.","However I will need you to be ready to work hard when you return.","Sure
 I understand.","Thank you.","No problem Mr. Williams.","Also
 again
 I hope your father makes a fast recovery.","Thank you very much.","I will touch base with you when I return to work again.","Please do.","There you are
 Ray.","Congratulations on your promotion to branch manager!","Thanks.","What's the matter?","You don't look so thrilled.","Oh
 of course I'm so happy.","I'm very honored to be the branch manager.","But
 I have to transfer to Minnesota.","Oh
 to Minnesota?","That's such a cold place.","Right?","You know how much I hate the cold.","I do but...","Don't worry about it.","You'll be fine.","I hope so.","By the way
 we want to celebrate your promotion.","We are planning to hold a promotion party for you.","That's very nice of you.","You don't have to though.","We want to.","We want to show our appreciation for your hard work.","You've been a great mentor for us.","Thank you so much.","Would next Friday at six o'clock work for you?","Yes
 I have nothing planned.","Great.","The party will be held at Room 56.","All of your family is invited.","I've had such a nice team.","I'm going to miss you guys so much.","We're going to miss you too.","Do you know who's replacing you?","Mr. Robinson from Iowa is taking over my spot.","He is a great guy.","I hope Mr. Robinson will be as great as you are.","He has big shoes to fill.","He will be just fine.","Good Morning
 Company A
 how may I help you?","Hello
 Could I speak to Mr. Jones please?","May I ask who's calling?","It's Joe Brown with Company B.","Could I ask the purpose of the call
 please?","Yes of course.","I met Mr. Jones at the IT conference in Las Vegas last week
 and he asked for me to call him.","He's away from his desk at the moment.","When would be a convenient time for me to call back?","I'm not really sure Mr. Brown.","You might want to try calling back tomorrow morning.","Or
 I can take a message and have him call you back.","Sure
 so as I said before
 we met at the IT conference and he had asked for me to reach out and schedule a time when I could do an online demonstration of our CRM.","I'm sorry
 but you're cutting out.","I think our phone lines may be acting up.","Can you hear me?","Yes I can hear you fine.","Could you please repeat the message?","He asked for me to reach out and schedule a time when I could do an online demonstration of our CRM.","Absolutely Mr. Brown.","What is a good number to reach you at?","He can call me on my cell
 it's XXXXXX-XXXX.","I'll give him the message as soon as I see him.","Thank you for your help.","How can I play this video on the monitor?","Select input one.","Then push the big circular button on the remote control.","OK
 now I'm at the home screen.","What do I do?","Push the down cursor and scroll through the applications.","Then select YouTube.","Then search for the video you want to play on the monitor.","TV used to be so easy.","These smart TVs confuse the heck out of me.","Well
 now we have so many capabilities that we didn't have before.","For example
 I can record a video on my smartphone and share it with the world in real time.","Yeah it really is amazing what we are capable of these days.","20 years ago if I wanted to share a video it would have been a lot of work.","First
 I would have had to record it on to video recorder.","Then upload it to my computer.","After that I would have had to burn it to a DVD.","I remember those days.","That's when I was in University.","I had a computer with a DVDR drive.","Then sharing it was really difficult.","You had to physically mail someone a DVD or hand it to them in person.","What do you think are some of the disadvantages of technology being so advanced?","People expect you to answer a call or text instantaneously.","So now we're always connected.","Have you ever heard of Analog August?","No
 what's that?","Well for the whole month of August
 you don't use anything digital.","That's impossible.","Most people probably cheat a little bit.","I did it last summer
 but only in my free time.","That way
 I can still do my job.","However
 when I was off the clock
 I wouldn't use anything digital.","Wow
 I'm so addicted to my smartphone I think I would go crazy.","What did you do with all of that extra time?","All kinds of cool stuff.","I took the kids fishing.","I grilled a lot of food in the backyard
 and listened to records.","Maybe I should try it this year.","OK
 let's see what we have today.","Is everybody here?","Mr. Matsumoto can't be here today.","He is out working on some other stuff and will come here in a couple of hours.","Well
 time is ticking - let's just start then.","What's new this year?","We kept the most popular items like candles
 cookies
 soaps.","New items are all about eco friendly stuff.","Stainless steel straws
 tumblers
 beeswax wraps
 bamboo toothbrushes
 shampoo bars.","Do you really think people will buy those things as a gifts?","People started to talk about not using plastic a lot this year.","I think that because of the power of social media
 eco friendly items are quite trendy at the moment.","The new items are not too pricey compared to the other items
 so people might consider buying them.","I guess we have to wait and see the results.","Don't forget to make the new items stand out from all other stuff.","Mr. Jones
 how about the order of items?","Shall we move it around or just keep it as it is?","I think what you guys did is fine.","Overall the colors turned out well.","Maybe we can make it a little bit less shiny.","Is it only me?","Shiny paper hurts my eyes to look at.","We want people to look at it as much as they can.","We will try to fix that problem.","When can you bring me the final pamphlet sample then?","It should be ready by next Wednesday.","Good
 I will see you guys then!","I think I had too much food.","Well
 it was so delicious.","I think I ate more than you.","Look at my big tummy.","Let's skip the coffee.","I will feel sick if I have coffee now.","Are you sure?","You will get really tired later without your coffee.","I will make some tea or something later if I really need it.","I just need to walk a bit now.","Do we have enough time for a short walk?","It's quarter to one.","I think we can make it back by one o'clock for sure.","That's great.","Let's get some fresh air before we have to go back inside.","I want to grab this little piece of candy before we go.","Do you want one?","Are you kidding?","No.","I'm so full.","You never know.","It might help.","No really.","I don't need to eat anything else right now.","Thank you
 though.","You're very welcome.","It helps me
 actually.","Let's get going.","Sure!","It's perfect weather for a walk.","I love how you enjoy the season everyday.","You love it rain or shine.","How do you do that?","I don't know.","I just love whatever we get.","As you said
 rain or shine.","Don't ask me about it.","I hate rainy days.","Oh I know that.","Thank goodness it's not raining right now.","Excuse me.","Can you help me?","Sure
 are you looking for something special?","I think I found what I want but there's no price tag on this.","Let me have a look.","Did you get this from the clearance section?","I checked the clearance section first
 but no luck there.","Alright
 let me go and grab my machine so I can check the price for you.","Or is it ok if I just take it with me and come back?","Whatever suits you is fine by me.","I will wait.","I can look around more while I'm waiting.","I will be right back.","Thanks.","Hi there
 thanks for waiting.","So this is actually from the clearance section.","Somehow the price tag fell off I guess.","Oh
 good news for me.","How much is it?","The original price is thirty four dollars but you can get fifty percent off.","That will be seventeen dollars plus tax.","Great.","I will definitely take that.","Is there anything else you need?","Nope
 I'm good.","I guess I will look for the same stuff but in different color.","I can do that by myself.","Thank you so much.","You're very welcome.","Enjoy your shopping.","Hi
 this is customer service.","How can I help you today?","Hi
 I was looking at your website just now.","I really want your lady bug costume but I'm a little bit confused about the size.","We have couple of lady bug costumes.","Which one did you like?","It's the one that comes with all the accessories.","You mean the one with the hair band
 mask
 wings and leggings?","Yep
 that's it.","I was checking the reviews from other people.","Some people said it was too small and others said it was too big.","So I just wanted to double check before I order it.","Yeah
 everybody is different
 so it can be tricky.","Of course.","How old is your child?","She's six.","I think she is quite skinny for her age though.","Well
 if that's the case I will suggest getting the small size.","Will that work
 you think?","Small is usually good for children up to six years old.","This costume is a pretty tight fit but it should work if she is skinny.","If you get the medium the leggings will be too long.","Hmmm
 okay.","I'm glad I checked with you.","I'm glad that helped.","Just so you know
 the item you want to order is almost out of stock.","Oh
 I'd better order it soon then.","There aren't many days left until Halloween.","Thanks for your advice.","You're very welcome.","Is there anything else that I can help you with?","Nope
 I'm good.","Have a great week.","Thank you for calling.","Have a wonderful week.","Okay
 so let's get started.","Anybody would like to report anything first?","Okay
 I would like to start with branch B sales report.","Our sales this year until 30 November is 3.5 million US dollars.","Unfortunately it's dropped by around 15 percent compared to last year sales.","And our branch's profit also dropped along with the sales.","The reason is because we lost one of our big clients.","Well
 that's too bad.","You have to find a way to recover.","Yes
 of course.","I will find a way to seek new client and business pipeline.","Okay
 any other who want to report?","Okay
 I would like to report about the development progress of our mobile application.","Our mobile application can now be downloaded from the Google Playstore or Appstore.","Since this application is still new and I think it needs much improvement
 I would like everyone here to download it and give a feedback.","Before we launch this mobile application to the public and broadcast the information to all of our client
 I would like to receive feedback from our employees first.","Okay
 it's great to know that finally our mobile application can be used.","Please broadcast the information to all of our employees and push them to use the mobile application and give feedback.","It will be good if we can launch this application before the end of the year.","Okay
 I will broadcast the information after this meeting.","Okay.","Guys
 I'm not really happy with our current supplier of machined parts
 can you recommend anyone else?","Why
 what's wrong with the current one?","I feel the quality has dropped a lot recently
 and we're often made to wait on orders.","I agree.","What do you think has changed?","They've expanded into such a large operation they can no longer cater to the requests of small companies like ours.","Exactly
 though we require high-precision parts
 we only need them in a small volume each time
 so I feel bigger orders are given priority over us.","Yes
 I think they squeeze us in between bigger orders
 and they don't have time to set up the machines properly.","Leading to less precision and delays
 I see.","There is one place I read about recently that could be promising.","Where's that?","They're called P Machining
 and they sound pretty innovative.","I think I've heard of them
 they use a lot of automation
 right?","Yes
 and they specialize in manufacturing low volume
 high-quality parts with quick turnaround times.","Plus
 they have a web interface
 so you can upload your CAD file and get an instant quote.","You can also track the production and shipping of parts online.","That all sounds great.","I'm intrigued
 but I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned.","I'd prefer to visit them in person and check out their equipment before making an order through a faceless computer screen.","Well
 I'll see if I can find that article I read.","It had their contact details on
 so I can look about setting that up.","Thanks Christian.","Can I ask you for a favor?","Sure.","I'm going to Brazil next week for a business trip.","But I'm actually not familiar with Brazil.","Do you think you can gather some materials on Brazil?","What kind of material are you looking for?","Well the business partner in Brazil is in the forest industry so information on that would be great.","Okay
 so the forest industry in Brazil.","Do you want information like number of sawmills
 and harvest data?","Can you also find out what their logging regulations are as well?","I think so.","What's the purpose of your meeting again?","I'm going to see if we should invest in their sawmill.","They produce lumber for the Chinese and European market.","I guess I should also look up where the port is and the trade data?","That would be great.","I can probably find the trade data from Brazil's government website.","Great.","How long do you think it will take?","I think I can get it done by the time you leave for your business trip.","Okay
 that's fine.","I can read it on the plane.","It's going to be a long flight.","I have to transfer once in Houston.","Good luck on your trip!","You want me to take on more responsibility?","Oh no
 you are not thinking...","Yes
 I think you are perfect for the position.","I'm not just talking about Multinational team
 I'm talking about the entire Sales Group.","This may be a good opportunity to restructure the Sales Group.","So although I was initially thinking just team leaders and abolishing group manager
 maybe we should have an experienced group manager after all so team leader positions could be given to more recent hires.","So
 you mean you want me to fill Mari's position?","You basically take over her entire package.","Pay
 benefits
 the whole nine yards
 so to speak.","I'm flattered that you use American colloquialism
 but don't you think Eugina is more of an appropriate choice?","Just hire someone new for Global Relations and Eugina can manage Sales.","I mean she has an MBA from an Ivy League and at least a decade of management experience.","First and foremost
 she doesn't want any more responsibilities.","She has made that clear.","You know her family situation
 right?","Yeah
 she told me she has a special needs son.","She really wants to focus on her family right now.","That's why she doesn't work full time.","Second of all
 it's about time you're rewarded for your work.","You know I'm a college dropout.","You mention that often.","Yeah
 I don't even know how I ended up being hired.","I'm finding out everyone else here is an ivy leaguer.","Mari
 John
 Eugina
 Taichi
 Won Bin
 Yumi
 all of our scientists
 not to mention our management
 and Kate!","Jesus
 she was Harvard Summa cum laude!","Not so
 I went to Cambridge.","Can you just not rub it in.","Keiko loves people who graduated high caliber schools.","She thinks it's an indication of something.","To me it's an indication of nothing.","All I care about is results.","You have built up the Small Cap group all by yourself.","You have enough experience.","Keiko's going to block it.","Keiko thinks highly of you and this one is my decision.","All I have to do is have Sylvester's approval and I'm confident I can get this through.","So are you in?","I am very honored to be here.","The pleasure is all mine.","I have read some of your papers you have submitted with your resume.","It was very impressive.","Thank you very much.","So you have had your own company for a while?","Yes
 Mr. Ko.","Although I think \"company\" is an overstatement.","It was a one man operation.","I was basically just making one lens after another
 and submitting patents.","Your resume is very interesting.","You received your PhD 8 years after you set up your own company.","Yes
 well
 engineers don't tend to go for PhDs.","We are content with a masters.","But I did a lot of work with universities and I was close with one doctoral advisor.","He advised me I might as well do a PhD since the work I was doing was equivalent to what I would do in a PhD program.","Basically all I had to do was submit a dissertation and defend it.","How many patents do you have?","About 110.","That is a lot!","That's really impressive.","How have you monetized that?","Well
 that's the problem.","I had about 200 patents so far
 but I had to sell nearly half of them.","At the end of the day
 lens alone won't get me anywhere
 unfortunately.","It's always used with something else
 and if that something else is made by a large corporation
 they basically take advantage of the fact that they have more power.","They know I need their business more than they need me.","So they force you to sell your patent?","It's that at a cheap price or \"not interested\".","Are you compensated well enough in any way for your discovery?","From my point of view
 no.","And that is why I have decided that just doing this myself is fruitless.","It's better to work with others to create something bigger.","But I don't want to be a cog in a big corporation.","I wanted to work somewhere that will appreciate my specialty and will able to utilize to the full extent what I make.","I think you have come to the right place.","Do we have any policy on working from home?","Like telecommuting?","Yeah.","I think the snow is going to be pretty bad next week so I was wondering if I can work from home if I'm snowed in.","Good point.","You have a company laptop and phone so you can technically work from home.","I think I will be more productive too.","I'm the type that feels more comfortable working at home.","I think we're all that type.","Let me go check with the administration department on the company policy.","I know we usually don't allow working from home on normal conditions.","But it can't be helped if you're snowed in.","Great
 thank you.","Let me know what they say.","Yeah
 I will.","Alright guys
 we only have twenty five minutes scheduled for today.","Let's try our best to finish up early.","It will be fairly quick
 I think.","Did you guys already talk about it?","Yeah
 we talked about it briefly.","That will make things easier.","As you know
 this year we will take a longer trip.","Please let me know who can't make it from each team as soon as possible.","Nobody likes last minute changes if it's about a trip.","Is this company trip mandatory for everyone?","Not really.","But
 of course
 it will be kind of an important trip for newcomers.","Lots of other teams say they want to try somewhere totally new this time.","I know it sounds great
 but if we do decide to go to somewhere new
 someone has to prepare a lot before we go.","We narrowed it down to Asia
 right?","Yes
 we just have to decide on which country we want to visit.","How about combining two countries this time?","Will that be too much
 do you think?","We have twelve days this time
 so if the countries are close enough
 it's possible.","I think China and Korea might work.","Or Japan and China?","Personally I would love to go to Thailand if we can.","If we want to try two countries this time
 Thailand might be a bit tricky.","Are we visiting some of our branches during this trip?","Well
 I might have to
 but not you guys.","Don't worry about that part.","That's good to know
 though.","Japan and Korea or Thailand and Vietnam will work for sure.","Let's put that plan to a vote.","Make sure that we take other suggestions
 too
 just in case.","Okay
 that sounds great.","I can send out the voting form through our company app today.","Oh
 that will be very helpful.","Once we decide
 we will talk about all the details later this month.","Sure
 during our lunch time?","Sounds perfect.","Yep
 I think we're ready to go.","Hello there
 my name is Henry Clements from Company A.","I wanted to reach out
 because we've been helping staffing agencies like yours find exceptional candidates.","I had a look through your job postings and thought we can maybe collaborate in sharing our candidate pool.","What kind of idea do you have in mind?","Well
 since your agency focuses a lot on the IT sector
 I was thinking of pooling our candidates together to find suitable candidates for more job posts.","How would we share the profits?","Say if we filled your job post with someone in our pool
 we would get 75 percent of the commission and you get 25 percent.","And vice versa.","Sorry I'm not too familiar with your agency.","Our agency is actually similar to yours.","We focus on the IT sector as well and some of our clients are Company B and Company C.","We've also been working with Company D for over ten years.","Oh
 is that right.","Yes so I am certain that our pool of candidates would suit your needs.","Where are you guys located?","We are just a couple blocks from your office.","Oh really.","Maybe we should have a face-to-face meeting to discuss this?","Yes
 that would be good.","When would be a good time for you?","How does this Friday sound?","Maybe around 2 o'clock?","Yes that sounds great.","I will look forward to meeting you on Friday then.","Have a good one then.","Bye now.","Hi John
 are you still available for our meeting today?","Of course
 I booked the meeting room number 5 from 3.","Ah great
 thanks!","We've still got about 15 minutes but the room looks available.","Shall we start early?","I mean
 only if you are ok with that.","Sure!","Ok great
 I will grab the file.","Here it is
 let's go!","Super!","Okay
 so
 first things first
 are you having a good time working here?","Is there anything that's concerning you?","Oh no
 everything is going very well.","I really appreciate the support everyone has been giving me.","It's only been a month since I started working in the department but I feel very welcomed and valued.","It's great.","Ah
 good to hear that.","Ok
 so I had a look at your feedback sheet
 and you have mentioned that there were some times that you had to manage some difficult situation.","Can I ask you about it?","Ah yes
 there were some issues with the production line and I was communicating with the factory.","The manager there was quite frustrated with the situation and I felt a little overwhelmed.","Especially because I still have a lot to learn about our products
 I feel like I made the situation more complex than it needed to be.","But Julia was there for me whenever I needed to ask her about things
 so that was a great help.","I see.","It does take a little while to get used to it but I am pretty sure you will get there quite quickly.","Thank you.","In the previous department I was just dealing with the numbers so everything is new to me
 but I am enjoying it.","Good to hear.","It takes a lot of courage to change your career path but I am happy that you are enjoying the new environment.","Thank you
 that's very kind of you.","Product development has always been my dream
 so I was over the moon when I could grab this chance.","Yeah
 Mark told me.","He is very happy with your work by the way.","As an HR
 it's always great to hear from people working happily together.","That's the best thing for our company to grow and stay healthy.","I agree.","Ok
 is there anything else you would like to talk to me about?","No
 I'm ok.","Alright
 well call me
 email me
 talk to me anytime if you need anything
 ok?","Thank you
 I will!","It seems that everybody is here
 let's begin this manager meeting.","First of all
 I need the administration to tell us what's new and what's known.","Yes
 I would like to start with new year's greeting cards
 which should be made by the end of the year.","As usual
 we will put down our company's address as the sender.","Therefore
 I will need each person to check if the addresses were correct.","We will send the cards based on our client database on the intranet.","The company addresses
 the names
 and the titles should be checked to make sure there is no mistake.","You know the client database gets updated each time.","We need to pay extra attention since we get quite a few cards back every year with unknown addresses.","Then does each person need to check to see if the client data is correctly updated?","Yes
 as I mentioned earlier
 I need the company addresses
 the departments
 the titles
 and the names.","Since it's only once a year
 this will be a good opportunity to check everything.","Also
 mark unnecessary for those who do not wish to receive the cards even though they are in the database.","When do you need them done?","By 5pm on Friday January first since I need to confirm the numbers we need at the same time.","Does each person decides who to send the card or not to?","I am okay letting each department make its own decision.","I am going to go with the data I will have at the time of the deadline.","Are we getting the printing company to do all the address printing and the shipping?","That's correct.","We won't see the cards ourselves even though I want to personally write down a message
 right?","Yes
 but I can give you the ones with blank address if you wish you put down addresses yourself.","In that case
 you need to mark unnecessary for those companies in the database.","And then send me an email to let me know how many you will need.","When do I receive the cards with blank addresses?","According to the schedule
 they should be delivered by December 15th.","I got it.","Any more questions?","I will be able to assist you as much as I can if you contact me personally
 so please feel free to do so.","Is that everything from the administration?","Yes.","Should we plan a welcome party for the new employee soon?","It has been two weeks since they have been assigned.","Do you want to schedule it the week after next?","Sounds good
 we will check everybody's schedule later.","We need to discuss where we are going to have it.","Since it's a weekend
 we will probably end up going to a couple of more places for after-party.","Everybody seems heavyweight as usual.","Then should we go to the same Izakaya as always?","We could try somewhere else for a change.","What kind of food should we choose?","How about Chinese?","We could bond much easier if everybody sits facing one another at a round table.","Chinese food
 it's a little heavy.","We have mostly young employees.","I will probably enjoy appetizers over Shaoxing wine.","Takada-san
 do you have any recommendation for Chinese food?","How about the Chinese restaurant in the basement of R hotel?","I will make a reservation once I get a head count.","That place is close by and has a bar on the top floor we can go for after-party.","If somebody gets wasted
 we could just let them spend the night there instead of forcing them to go home.","There will be cabs waiting even if we miss the last train.","How much should each person pay?","Of course the new employees pay nothing.","The higher the title
 the price should go up for the rest of the employees.","Once the number is confirmed
 I will discuss the course menu with the restaurant.","I am going to go ahead and decide on the price as well.","I hope it will be reasonable for the general employees.","I will probably set the price for about 5000 yens for the non-managerial employees.","Managers might want to brace themselves though.","Don't you worry I will personally talk to the managers about it.","By the way
 how do you normally pay for the after party?","Not everybody knows this
 but everybody above managerial positions plays Rock Paper Scissors
 and whoever loses pays the full amount.","Oh
 wow
 I have never heard about it.","For your information
 it was me who paid for the after party last month.","I did not know that
 thank you so much for that.","This is Asano.","This is Nakada from executive assistance office.","Would you come to the president's office?","Yes
 I'll be there right away.","Excuse me
 this is Asano from business development department.","Mr. Asano
 sorry for calling you to come in such a short notice.","This is about you relocating to overseas which we have been talking about.","Yes.","We are assigning you to go to Los Angeles as of May 1st.","Los Angeles?","Thank you.","I know you wanted to go to San Francisco
 but I want you to research opportunities to expand our business in Los Angeles.","I am grateful to go to California that I admire.","Your term will be at least three years
 and it will be extended depending on circumstances.","What are your going to do about your family?","Yes
 my child is still in kindergarten
 and my wife has an experience studying overseas
 so I would like to relocate with my family.","Sounds good.","We will apply your visa soon
 so it will hopefully be issued in time by the month after next
 but visas for your family might take longer.","Your visa will be L1.","Yes
 I am aware.","You will go there first
 then your family will go to US afterwards.","Your first year residence will be determined by our Los Angeles office
 but you may move to a place that you find on the second year
 as long as it is within our budget.","Yes
 I understand.","I will ask Mr. Tanuma from Los Angeles office to take care of you until you find your way around.","I have heard about Mr. Tanuma.","Although he was born in the US
 his Japanese is perfect
 and he is excellent all around.","That's what I heard.","Your car will be leased by the company
 but you need to get a driver's license first.","I agree.","You have to think about your child's kindergarten.","I will have my wife research on that.","You will be busy preparing for the move
 please take care.","Yes
 working overseas is what I have been wanting to do
 so I will be fine.","I have been mentally preparing for this.","Glad to hear.","I am counting on you.","You are the key to expand our company's business overseas.","I feel humble.","I will do my best.","Why don't we have dinner together before you move?","Okay
 shall we go right in to it.","Yes
 I'd like to show our company's new product today.","This is the high-spec camera.","Please take a look.","What's the difference from the previous model.","First of all
 there are more functions.","However
 the number one feature of this product is this compact size.","It took 2 years to develop this.","This small size is indeed impressive.","Is it selling well?","Of course.","It is our company's popular product.","I see.","Our company's product is well received for its good quality and reasonable price.","Is that right.","I wanted to talk about the price that you are proposing.","Yes
 the camera's unit price is 80
000 yen.","Is there a discount for purchasing in large lots?","Yes
 we can provide a 5 percent discount for buying 100 of them.","Can you lower the price a bit more?","Unfortunately
 that will be a bit difficult.","This is the best price our company can offer.","I see.","I'd like to compare the price with other suppliers and I'll get back to you accordingly.","Okay.","Please do consider us.","Tomoi-san
 do you have a moment?","What's wrong?","We will be newly implementing Company A's system next time.","I thought of asking them to use our existing contract so I showed them our template.","But there were sections pointed out by their legal counsel.","They asked to change some of the language but what should we do?","What exactly was it?","It's as this document shows.","It seems they are also dealing with their legal counsel through the legal department.","They told us to execute the contract directly with the legal department.","Okay.","Then
 can you send me this document and the contact information of the person in charge at the legal department by email?","Okay.","I will consult with our legal counsel.","Afterwards
 I will contact the person in charge of legal affairs on their side and figure out the contract.","Thank you very much.","What's the deadline on executing the contract?","Their request is February 1st which is when the new system will be implemented.","So we still have three months.","Yes
 but the actual implementation work will have to start from next month otherwise we won't make it in time.","I'd like to get the contract related matters out of the way by the time we start the work.","Okay
 I'll talk to our legal counsel right away.","Okay
 I will send you the document by email once I get back to my seat.","Okay
 thank you.","Hello this is Metropolitan Police Department C police station.","Thank you as always
 my name is Takada from Company I.","Sorry but can you transfer me to the Organized Crime Department?","Yes
 please hold.","Thank you for holding
 this is the Organized Crime Department.","Thank you as always
 my name is Takada and I'm in charge of running the general meeting of shareholders for Company I.","Yes
 hello.","We have decided the date and time for our company's general meeting of shareholders and would like to ask you for your presence there.","Thus I'd like to drop by once with the application for the request.","Oh is that right?","Around when will you be coming?","I'd like to come at a time that works with your side.","We're not too busy with cases right now so anytime is fine.","Then can I drop by tomorrow afternoon?","When is a good time?","How about getting you to come around 5 o'clock in the afternoon?","Okay.","Sorry
 who should I look for?","Oh
 you can just look for me.","My name is Tada and I'm the assistant inspector.","So it's Mr. Tada?","Okay.","I
 Takada from Company I will go to your place at 5 o'clock in the afternoon tomorrow.","Okay
 I will wait for you.","Thank you very much for dealing with me despite being busy.","Bye now.","Thank you very much for your hard work everyone.","We practiced the general meeting according to the scenario but how was it?","First of all
 can we get some feedback from you
 Nose-san?","Yes
 good job everyone.","I think it went smoothly overall.","But I'd like to comment on some things.","First of all
 you guys bow when you come into the hall
 and bow together just before sitting down.","The timing is a bit off during that so everyone should bow at the same time.","Okay
 when everyone gets to their position at the bowing before sitting down
 I will give you guys a wink.","The executives will then bow in accordance to that.","Okay
 let's do that.","Next
 when president Arakawa is reading the report topics
 other executive are looking down which stands out.","When president Arakawa is speaking
 please look towards the shareholders as much as possible.","Okay
 let's get this right.","How was the way I talked and my speed?","I have nothing to comment
 I think it's just right.","Okay
 next is during the questions and answers.","I'd like to point out a couple things here.","First of all
 what did you think about it
 Takada-san?","Well
 the executives aside from president Arakawa
 were nervous and looking around when chosen so please stop that.","I think it would be better if we are more confident.","Also
 I think it's okay to take notes of the content of the question but I think it looks bad if we do not face the person asking the question at all.","I think it would be better if we looked more towards the people asking the questions as much as possible.","I agree with the things pointed out by Takada-san.","If the impression towards the shareholders asking the questions are negative
 there is a possibility of the questions becoming awkward.","Takada-san was just asking questions after questions but what would be a smart way to deal with that in a situation like that?","It is not always the case that there will only be one question from the shareholder asking the question.","When answering the questions from the shareholders
 be sure to recite the questions one by one and review it.","And
 at the end of the answer
 be sure to add 'that will be it for my answer' and end the question.","By ending the question
 we can hold off unnecessary statements related to it.","I see.","How was the answer for the questions and answers?","You stated the truth clearly and I thought it was very good.","But as for the business for the future
 the content was a bit too positive and might give them high expectations which kind of worried me.","I understand where president Arakawa is coming from but there is a risk in releasing information that is basically close to a commitment.","I think it would be good to hold back on that a bit.","Okay
 got it.","Thank you for calling company I
 this is Noda speaking.","Hope you guys are doing well
 this is Nose from Trust Bank M.","Hope all is well with you too
 are you calling for Mr. Takada?","Yes please
 is he in?","Just a moment please.","This is Takada speaking.","This is Nose from M Trust Bank.","Thank you for your business as always.","Is this a good time to talk?","Sure
 what's going on?","Just one thing
 another department of ours wanted me to tell you this.","What's that?","They want to give you a proposal of conducting questionnaires with your shareholders.","Our company has a team specifically assigned to work on an area like this.","They want to see if you guys are interested in sending the questionnaires along with the notice of shareholders resolution to conduct a survey on your investor relations.","They can propose a new
 better approach for investor relations based on the summary of the answers.","The department in charge will give you the detailed proposal later on
 but I would like to set up an appointment for that if possible.","You have done so much for us
 how can I say no to your request.","Of course
 I would love to hear the proposal.","When will be a good time for you?","Since I have quite a few scheduled outings and guests coming this week
 some time after this week will be good.","I don't have any outing or appointments scheduled on next Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons
 so those days will work for me.","Ok
 I will set it up and get back to you by the end of the day.","Are you going to be at the meeting as well?","Both the person in charge and I will be there.","I gotcha.","Alright
 let me know when you decide on the time.","Yes sir
 I will get back to you soon.","Talk to you soon.","The customer you were on the phone with earlier
 is that company YC?","Yes it was.","I just remembered that I did business with company YC before.","Oh
 I did not know that.","Back then
 I was told they want to use product A with thin clients overseas.","They did not mention anything about overseas this time round.","Then they must have decided to try it out with the domestic ones first to see how it works.","When I was on the phone with them
 I was asked if product A works on computers that are located out of the country.","So I didn't give too much thought to it and replied that we have English versions.","What countries are we talking about here?","China
 Korea
 Taiwan
 Indonesia
 mostly Asian countries.","We don't really have plans to make other language versions available
 right?","Yeah
 I thought so too
 and I told them we would not carry Chinese and Korean versions.","I see.","I don't think anything was wrong with your reply at this moment.","Assuming the domestic introduction goes smoothly
 they might start thinking about using it overseas as well.","That's true
 I try to remember that.","But technically it would not work.","Besides
 some parts of product A are subject to export restrictions.","Oh
 I am aware of that.","It sounds like product A should be used strictly in Japan.","Yes
 that's the only option we have.","Mr. Cooper
 do you have any other ideas?","Ones that appeal to Japanese people
 please.","Okay.","Do Japanese people like gift exchanges?","Gift exchange are more familiar as we do them from when we are kids.","If so
 then a white elephant might be good.","What's a white elephant?","I don't understand the meaning at all
 would you please explain it?","Basically
 it is a unique gift exchange.","Each one of us prepares a unique gift that's about one thousand yen.","Then we put those in one place without telling who bought it
 and pick and open a gift one by one.","Opening a gift must be exciting.","That's not all.","The second person can either open a new gift or steal a gift from another person.","The people who had their gift taken away are unfortunate
 aren't they?","If someone steals the gift you opened
 you can pick a new one to open or steal another one.","That makes sense.","We continue doing that until everyone's gifts are decided.","Does this game ever end?","It sounds like it doesn't end if you keep stealing gifts.","One gift can be stolen up to three times
 so that's fine.","It's exciting until the end of the game.","The price for the gift isn't too expensive
 and it will not be a burden to everyone.","It's ok if you have something you don't need in your house.","White elephant also means an unnecessary thing.","It is that we should have fun
 while getting rid of things we don't need.","I like this idea.","Me too.","It sounds difficult to do with all fifty employees
 so should we do it by department?","If so
 each department has ten people
 so do you think that is just the right number?","That sounds perfect.","The rules sound a little bit complicated
 so should we sum them up on a piece of paper and hand them out?","Why don't we notify everyone three weeks before we do the white elephant?","Let's do that.","I think everyone will understand the rules once we start playing the game.","Right.","I never thought I could do a white elephant at a Japanese company.","I'm getting excited.","I'll wear an ugly sweater on that day.","I will too then.","Ms. Hikida
 do you have a minute?","Sure
 what is it?","Don't tell me that you are quitting the company?","No
 that's not right.","Actually
 I wanted to inform you that I'm getting married next spring.","What...","Really?","That was sudden
 but was is it shotgun marriage?","No
 I'm not pregnant.","I see
 that's good.","Pardon me?","I thought we are losing another employee.","I was thinking to continue working even after getting married...","But you will be quitting right after you get a child
 right?","Ms. Urada has quit only three months ago.","I'm teaching so much
 but I lose motivation if my employees keep quitting their jobs like this.","Even if I teach with a passion
 most of them quit their job after three years.","In Ms. Urada's case
 her husband had a transfer so there was no other way
 right?","It's the same thing.","I'm hoping to keep working as long as I can.","Someday when I have a child
 I would like to take advantage of maternity leave and child care leave.","I see.","Both my parents were working
 so I'm thinking to do the same.","If so then that's fine.","But anyways
 congratulations.","Thank you.","Good morning Murata-san.","Good morning Kobayashi-san.","Thank you for the meeting the other day.","Did you come up with a plan on expanding abroad?","Hmm
 I've been thinking but it's not easy.","I know
 right?","We've never exported abroad before so I don't know where to start thinking about it.","I know.","I'm thinking of setting a target and a goal first but I can't quite make up my mind.","Same with me.","We are to think of a plan for the trial export this time but I haven't been able to decide if we should target Japanese people or the locals.","The plan will be completely different based on that.","I thought of targeting locals but there are so many things to think about that I don't know what to do.","We're not an official department yet so we don't have a budget to conduct a field survey.","I know.","I think for a trial
 it might be better if we target Japanese people as Komiya-san said.","Let's go with that and maybe I'll discuss this with Sato-san.","Yeah
 I'll think about it a bit more but that may be the safest bet.","This is A company.","Yes
 hello
 this is Yamamoto.","I decided to call you after seeing your company's website.","Thank you for calling.","What can I help you with?","I'm interested in one of your B puzzles that I saw on your online shop.","However
 it says on the page that it's sold-out.","When will it be available again?","Are you inquiring about the B puzzle?","I apologize for the inconvenience.","The manufacturer no longer produces it so we won't be able to stock up on this item any longer.","Discontinued
 huh...","I wanted to buy it for my grandchild because it seemed like an engaging game.","I've tried other shops but I couldn't find any.","I'm willing to stop by your shop if you have it in stock even if it's a bit far.","Could you inform me of any?","Well
 about that ...","We actually still have one available here.","But the box has been somewhat flattened.","We removed it from our stocks due to this reason.","There should be no problem with what's inside though.","We can put this back up on sale if you don't have a problem with the condition of the box.","I see.","So there shouldn't be a problem with the puzzle pieces inside?","That's right.","I don't mind.","I'm going to throw the box out anyway.","Alright then.","Thank you very much for your understanding.","We'll have it delivered to you with the shipping fee covered.","Oh
 you'll have it sent to me?","That would be a great help!","Are you alright with cash on delivery as the method of payment?","Yes.","If you have a fax machine
 I can send you the order invoice with the price included.","Okay
 I'll give you my number.","My number is xxxx-xx-xxxx.","I'll send the invoice to you as soon as possible.","Okay
 I'll be waiting for it.","Sure thing.","Is everybody here?","Yes
 we have everyone now.","Shall we start
 then?","Today we are talking about introducing company electric vehicles.","Our company cars are getting old by now.","How many EVs are we planning to buy?","Initially
 two cars.","As you know
 the petrol has been going up.","We don't have to worry about the petrol if we have the EVs.","Electric cars are eco-friendly as they have no emissions.","Yeah
 that's true
 but..","I'm afraid the electric bill would go up enormously.","Definitely.","However
 the petrol costs will be reduced as well.","In addition
 we may receive a credit from the company for the efficiency.","So
 I guess we can offset the electric bill for the time being.","That sounds good.","We can find electric car battery-charge stations in various places these days.","I was thinking I should give it a go.","EVs have more advantages for the fuel efficiency.","For instance?","You can use a HOV lane on a motorway.","So
 you can avoid the jam during the busy rush hours in the morning and evening
 right?","That'll be great.","Absolutely!","Our customer K Motor factory says they will give us a discount if we purchased more than two EVs.","So
 I guess we've agreed to introduce electric vehicles for the sake of our company as well as the environment.","I look forward to trying it.","So do I.","There's another company drinking party this Friday.","Again?","We just had one last week.","Last week was a farewell party and it is the year-end party this time.","Why do Japanese companies have so many drinking parties?","It's really a hassle to have your time committed to the company even after work hours.","I know
 right.","It's been 3 years since I started working at the Japan branch but I'm getting fed up with it.","It was fun in the beginning though.","I'm scared when I have to tell my wife about the drinking party.","You know that my wife is pregnant
 right?","Oh
 has the morning sickness settled down?","No
 not yet.","And I have to look after my 2 year old boy who's rambunctious.","She was pretty irritated about the drinking party last week too.","I don't blame her.","Honestly
 she is saying she wants to go back to the States.","She doesn't want to go through all this and be in Japan.","When we were back in the States
 I'd go home right after work and enjoyed family time.","But we've been fighting all the time since coming to Japan.","They say drinking parties in Japan is free to join yet there is an unwritten rule that you're forced to attend.","It's so stupid.","They say it's casual yet we have to always be attentive to the superiors.","It's not like we get paid for this too.","Yet
 they collect money for the drinking fee.","I can't understand the system in Japan at all.","Gary
 I don't think you have to attend this week.","You should first consult with Yamamichi-san.","I will let him know about your situation with your wife too.","That would be helpful.","Doesn't your wife say anything?","My wife is Japanese so she's used to these kind of things.","She's actually not too fond of it though.","She's given up and just says it can't be helped if it's work.","I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing.","Her dad was like that too.","Is that right.","Should I introduce my wife to your wife next time?","I think she will feel better if she has a friend she can rant to.","Yes
 please.","Hello.","This is Oyama from the HR department.","I would like to talk about employment
 can you give me a moment?","Do you have anything in particular you would like candidates to be able to do.","Let's see...","I understand you will be asking about academic background and job history.","However
 I think we need someone who is able to go on business trips as required for the position.","You are right.","Frequent international and domestic business trips are part of the job requirement.","So please don't invite them to have a second interview if they are not interested in those.","Alright.","Thank you.","By the way
 I will be out of the office next Monday.","Therefore please avoid that date when scheduling interviews.","I understand.","Thank you.","No problem
 bye.","Company G sent us the payment records for this year by registered mail.","What
 with registered mail?","Right?","Regular mail would have been fine.","I recall receiving it by regular mail before.","Did we receive any other payment records from other companies yet?","No not yet.","The one from Company G was the first for me this year too.","Did the law change without us knowing about it?","Like having to send it by registered mail?","Maybe.","The president there is super busy and over thinks a lot.","He might have thought that it had to be registered mail and told the administration person to do it that way.","The veteran left and a new person started in the fall.","The person who sends the payment records is new too?","Maybe.","Well
 it's better than having it lost even though you sent it and having to resend it.","Yeah
 that's true.","But
 when I got the delivery notice of delivery records in the mailbox
 I was surprised as I didn't know what it was.","The company didn't contact you that they sent it?","No there was nothing.","It's not a big deal though.","If they give me a heads up then there was no need for me to be surprised.","I guess the person is new so they aren't that thoughtful.","Saeda-san
 thank you very much for taking the trouble to make time for me today.","What's wrong
 you specified a cafe outside instead of at the office.","It must be something serious if you don't want others to hear about it.","I actually plan on getting married in December.","Is that right
 congratulations.","I was thinking of asking you to attend.","Of course
 of course I will attend.","And I also have another thing to tell you.","I am actually pregnant as well.","Well that's double the congratulations.","When is it due?","I'm due next June and I'm in my second month.","I thought I should let you know as soon as possible
 but sorry for the delay.","I didn't notice at all
 and I learned about it after the check up at the gynecologist the other day.","You don't have to worry about that.","So what do you plan to do about work?","Do you want to take maternity leave and come back
 or just quit your job?","I discussed this with my husband too but I'd like to come back if possible.","The work and work place is really enjoyable.","So you will come back
 that's great!","The senior managing director knows you're doing good work so please do come back.","I'm honored.","Since that's decided
 you don't have to do any work that you do now that uses your body.","Your health is the most important so others can do these.","Thank you very much.","You will need to apply for maternity leave too.","If you're due in June
 then you will take maternity leave from April?","Yes
 it would be great if I can take my leave from around that time.","When would you like to come back to work after you give birth?","I am thinking of returning half a year later around December.","But doing full-time like now might be a bit hard.","If possible
 I'd like to use flex-time.","Ah
 the one Nogami-san who is your senior is doing
 right?","I think she leaves 1 hour earlier than usual so at 5 o'clock
 right?","Yes
 I would like to have my work hours like that as well.","Okay
 I will talk to the management.","Thank you very much!","If it gets too tough before you give birth
 don't push yourself and you can leave early or come later too.","Anyway
 take care of your body.","Again
 thank you very much!","Sudo-san
 can I talk to you about the result of the check-up you took last time?","Yes
 how was it?","There was an issue since an industrial doctor was called
 right?","Unfortunately yes.","You're blood pressure at its peak is 160 and is on the high side
 is there anything that you feel uncomfortable?","I felt a bit tired after climbing stairs but nothing in particular aside from that.","The standard figure for a male is 130 so there is a need to make this number better.","Okay
 sorry.","And you're abdominal circumference is over 100 centimeters.","Basically you're overweight.","Yes
 I did realize that my stomach was popping out.","The reason for being overweight is related to your lifestyle.","In other words
 it can be fixed if you change your lifestyle.","I would like to give you instructions on this.","My kids are still young so I need to stay healthy
 so thank you for your help.","First of all
 can you tell me what you eat?","I sleep until I really need to leave so there are a lot of times when I don't eat.","I go visit clients a lot so I eat out a lot for lunch.","What do you usually eat when you eat out?","I like noodles so I go to ramen stores often.","Do you only eat ramen?","Just ramen isn't satisfying enough so I also eat gyoza or fried rice.","For dinner
 I usually have a drink after visiting clients before going home.","What do you usually order with your drink?","I've never really put a lot of thought on it.","Usually deep-fried stuff like karaage
 and kushi-katsu.","And after I drink
 I will eat ochazuke or rice when I get home.","I drink beer again at home and I fall asleep before you know it.","I know it's not good for me but it just happens.","I don't want to sound so harsh but if you keep this lifestyle up
 your body might fail on you in 5 years.","That's not good.","It's hard to change right away but let's start changing things slowly.","First
 make sure you eat breakfast.","Currently
 you don't eat breakfast so you eat a lot during lunch.","Instead of ordering single-items for lunch
 please make it into a set meal and make an effort to eat a more balanced meal.","For the evening
 limit yourself to going to bars 2 times a week
 and try to eat at home.","And instead of ordering oily deep-fried snacks at the bar
 ordering things like edamame and chilled tofu would be good.","Sleeping right away is not good so let's hold off on the ochazuke.","How about we start but controlling what you eat first rather than focusing on exercising.","Okay
 I'll try it since I want to live long.","Takada-san
 can I ask your opinion about something?","What?","At next week's meeting about the preparations for the shareholders' general meeting
 I'd like to select the gift that we will give out in the general meeting.","I'm thinking of presenting several potential gifts
 but do you have any good ideas?","What's the budget?","I think about 1
000 yen per attending shareholder should be about right.","There were about 100 attendees last year
 weren't there?","Yes
 122 people attended last year.","We prepared 200 gift sets last year
 at a price of 1
040 yen per person.","What were last year's gifts again
 a 500 yen gift voucher and some confections?","Yes
 the confections were steamed buns that had the company logo printed on them.","And how were they received?","Not badly at all
 the only issue was that they had a short expiration date.","We shared the leftover buns amongst people in the company
 but there wasn't a general feeling that we would do them again the next year.","What do you think would be good?","Well
 due to the profit warning this quarter
 plenty of shareholders have spoken quite harsh words to me over the phone.","Since there could be a bad atmosphere at this year's general meeting of shareholders
 I was thinking something to calm emotions would be good.","Wow
 that's pretty abstract.","Can you not think of anything specific?","Something like dove-shaped shortbread might be nice.","Why?","Well
 a dove is a symbol of peace
 isn't it.","When I have to appear at a meeting I think is going to be rough
 or a financial results briefing
 I always make the effort to wear a scarf with a pattern of doves on it.","I mean
 I guess it's kind of a superstition.","Plus
 everybody likes baked goods
 and above all
 they have long expiration dates.","I didn't think you were so superstitious.","It doesn't really matter what it is
 but sometimes you just want something to cling to.","That sounds tragic.","After hearing your story
 I've also come round to the idea of dove-shaped confectionery.","I will present it as one of the potential choices.","Thanks.","Kawakami-san
 your company has a very impressive conference room.","I wish we could work at an office like that.","Speaking of an office
 I know our company is looking for a new location.","Is that true
 there is a vacant space on the second floor.","Since you are already here
 would you like to take a tour?","I think the management happens to be on the second floor right now.","I guess I can tour take a tour since you offered.","Kawakami-san
 please take us there.","What
 there is nothing
 not even a partition.","It's just an open floor with nothing.","This is Mr. Kuwata from our tenant managing department.","Nice to meet you
 I am Kuwata.","I am Egami from S trading company
 great to meet you.","I am Yamada also from S trading company
 pleasure to meet you.","Let's get to the point
 this empty area could be divided and turned into your ideal office space.","If you use floor-to-ceiling partitions
 it could be divided just like rooms.","I see
 Yamada-san
 did your floor use to look like this too?","Yes
 it was.","We will divide the area according to our client's wish.","Partitions aren't quite the same as walls
 will I hear noises through the them?","It would become an issue if other employees could overhear meetings that discuss sensitive subjects.","Don't worry
 you will have nothing to worry about.","We could easily solve this with sound-proof partitions.","The soundproof ability will even become much higher if you choose double-glass partitions.","We could also use a noise masking system to solve this problem.","This system emits a soft
 inconspicuous background sound to prevent noise leaks.","Seems like there is a variety to choose from.","Also there is usually a gap between the door and the floor
 and you could also fill this gap to keep the noises from leaking.","Looks like we will not have any issues with all these possible solutions.","Our company stores some classified documents
 and is there anything security system we could install?","You have nothing to worry.","You could install blinds inside to give the room some privacy.","Of course a security system could be installed in the room as well.","What do you mean?","This very room you just entered normally has a security system at the door.","In order to keep outsiders from entering
 the security card is required to open the door.","Additionally
 a selected few could be given the authority to enter the room.","Does it mean other employees aren't permitted to come in the room even if they want to?","Yes
 exactly.","There is a vacancy on the seventh floor
 and we could go check it out if you want.","Ahh
 what should I do next?","Oh
 I thought you were done for the day
 Kento?","Well
 I just have my current contract on my mind.","Your contract will end at the end of next year
 right?","Yes
 the current project will be over in one year
 so I should figure out what to do next before another long term project starts.","Argh
 that's the thing about researchers
 usually with fixed-term contracts.","My grant for Scientific Research will be expired soon
 too.","Isn't there anything that could be done about that 5-year-term for KAKENHI fund
 since most of the projects runs for 10 years or longer?","Well
 that's all up to the great MEXT to decide
 you know?","But we're lucky this C National Institute has connections to places like MIC
 so we can work in a pretty good environment.","There aren't many labs with sufficient budget so it would be pretty harsh if you accidentally choose one of those places that can't raise funds.","That reminds me of a huge project in Singapore that was deadlocked because of lack of funds a while ago.","See
 oh
 I might be wrong but are you looking at laboratories abroad as well?","Well
 I should keep my options open
 right?","I'm a kind of guy who'd like to stay in Japan
 and I don't want to get farther from Kokubunji station.","Ha-ha
 just because it's easier to submit applications
 isn't it
 Yo?","But
 seriously
 laboratories in Japan are not bad
 like the one in K university which is doing pretty well with patents.","That's true
 but at the moment
 it's a rare case within the country that university-industry research collaboration is working out like that.","After all
 my choice out of labs in universities would be CM University or UC University in the US
 I guess.","If you're thinking of going to the States
 a friend of mine from college is at C Institute of Technology now
 and says it's pretty comfortable with bunch of Asian people.","He also says quite a few Asian researchers are producing results there.","Uh-huh
 I believe that institute doesn't support affirmative action
 so that's probably why there are more Asians.","You're an excellent researcher and a fluent English speaker
 I'm sure you'd have no problem moving there.","Your wife has also studied abroad
 hasn't she?","Yeah
 but it's not only the language matter you have to consider when you move abroad with your family.","My whole family have to get used to many things
 like the work place
 school
 and lifestyle........","But moving there alone is not your option
 right?","Of course not
 with a multi-year contract
 I cannot leave my family here.","If you'd have hard time getting used to things
 you might as well find a job in Europe
 like K Institute in Sweden.","Hmm
 K Institute probably wouldn't take me with my field of expertise.","How about M-P Institute in Germany
 they have researchers from a wide variety of fields
 don't they?.","Aww
 I was trembling as I went through their annual report the other day!","Well
 it's well known that the positions at M-P are low-paid
 so I wouldn't be able to stay for long
 you see?","Whoa
 I'm so jealous that you can actually think of working there.","Working in Germany
 well
 it sounds pretty good
 but still the salary is a hurdle
 I guess.","Instead
 you can build reputation as a researcher.","It seems that most people quit after 5 years or so and get high-paid jobs elsewhere.","I would love to join them if I was capable enough!","Yo
 I thought I heard you said that you'd like to stay in Japan
 just a few minutes ago.","Well
 Kanto
 if I got an offer from them
 I'd just fly there right away
 even without pay!","Good morning.","Good morning.","How may I help you?","It's my first day today.","Oh
 nice to meet you.","Thank you.","I would like to apply for a parking permit.","Ok
 sure.","Then
 could you please fill out this form and hand it back to me?","Okay.","Will I be able to park from tomorrow?","Yes.","Please leave this sticker on the dashboard.","Yes
 sure.","Am I getting an allocated car park?","No
 it's on a first come first serve basis.","Oh
 but what happens if there aren't any spots to park?","You don't need to worry too much
 as there's plenty of available parking.","That's good to hear.","Is it a long drive for you?","Yes
 it would take one and a half hours even by car.","I see.","The car park opens between six o'clock in the morning and twelve o'clock at night.","Ok
 I'll remember that.","You will be required to submit a notification form if you plan on leaving your car in the parking area overnight
 while you're away on business.","Ok
 I got it.","The sticker needs to be renewed annually.","Ah
 ok.","Please notify us should your car type
 address or car registration change.","Yes
 sure.","Do you have any questions?","Well
 what about the parking fee?","It's free.","Great.","Then
 I will park there from tomorrow.","Thank you very much.","You're welcome.","Hi
 I have an appointment with Mr.Kanda from 2.","Hello!","Could I have your name please?","Sure
 it's Wataru Takaoka.","Thank you.","Kanda is expecting your visit in the meeting room.","Please follow me.","Thank you.","Here it is.","Mr.Kanda
 Mr.Takaoka has arrived.","Ok thanks!","Hi Mr.Takaoka
 thank you for coming!","Thank you for inviting me.","This is a beautiful office.","The building itself
 the entrance
 it's all very big.","Ahaha
 thank you.","Did you use that glass elevator?","Using that is my favorite part of coming here every day.","Yes!","It was very thrilling
 I almost felt like I was floating in the air.","Exactly.","Alright
 so as I explained to you in the email
 I urgently need you to translate this manual as we decided to install another device to the guestroom.","It is a digital code lock
 and although how it works is quite simple
 it can be a bit tricky to get used to it.","Here is the actual machine.","We valued the aesthetic a bit too much
 and can you see?","You have to push here to open the cover but it's quite difficult to notice for the first time.","Ah.","Also
 to make the numbers appear on the screen
 you need to press the screen.","So these two things are potentially confusing to users
 and I need a good userguide in English so that our guests will not have to spend hours trying to figure out how to unlock the room they are staying in.","I understand.","However
 we do not want to stick notes all over it.","We need a simple but clear instruction.","Ok
 I can come up with something.","Can I borrow the manual so that I can fully understand the system?","Sure
 there are many so I can give you one.","Thank you.","When do you need this by?","If you could send the idea by Friday that would be great.","Sure
 I will start working on it.","Thank you!","Thank you for your attendance
 everyone.","Today I'd like to brainstorm some ideas to increase sales.","I was thinking of employing a customer loyalty program.","It's been very successful with other companies.","How would ours work?","I know there are many different ways to do it
 such as an app or a stamp card.","We would probably use a point-based system.","We'll have customers sign up at the register
 where we'll give them a card that can be scanned at the register.","They'll get points for each smoothie they order.","They will also get more points if their order is more expensive.","Once they rack up enough points
 they can get a free cup of smoothie.","You could also have special deals for members.","Maybe on certain days if a customer brings their card they can get 10 percent off of their smoothie
 or something like that.","That's a great idea!","Any other ideas?","How about instead of a card
 we do a reusable cup?","We can give customers a discount everytime they bring in their cup.","More people are trying to be environmentally conscious anyway.","I think we could sell different designs
 and even metal straws.","If we include our logo
 it might also provide a bit of advertising for our stores.","That also seems like a good idea.","I can see the pros and cons to both.","Perhaps we could integrate the reusable cups into the point system.","That could work.","We could sell the cups in the store
 but still have the membership program be on the card.","But if you're a member
 maybe you can get a discount on the cup or get it for free as a reward.","I'll have to think about it a bit more
 but thank you for the ideas.","Ms. Bessho
 can your team prepare a few design ideas for the cup and card by next week's meeting?","Of course.","Thank you.","We'll finalize our ideas at next week's meetings."
